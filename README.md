This is a practice project showing how to create an Android overlay window
that appears on top of all apps. The overlay is built using a Foreground Service,
WindowManager, and Jetpack Compose inside a custom LifecycleComposeView.

Features:
- Floating overlay window
- Foreground Service with TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY
- Jetpack Compose UI rendered inside WindowManager
- Dismiss button and lifecycle handling
- Basic architecture for system alert windows
